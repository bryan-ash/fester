Bugs
- Equipment drop down needs a default other than the first available (prompt)
- editing a load creates extra transactions
- jumper slot gets 2 transactions when slot is added to a load

Authentication
- Display logged in user name on menu bar
- forgotten username
- forgotten password

Import SkyWriter data
- Validate input
- Reformat name to be First Last

Removed Register link for the time being

Authentication
- needs some feature descriptions

Transactions
- delete a transaction when associated slot is deleted
- prevent a transaction from being deleted if it is for a slot
- Transactions should list in date reverse order
- Put "New" link at top of page
- Transactions (and slot) should be links on Account/edit page
- ? link to new transaction from Account/edit page

Manifesting
- Default altitude for jump types
- Default cost for jump type
- Default cost for Equipment?
- Picking our aircraft should blank Other
- Entering Other should uncheck radio buttons
- Display multiple slots dependant on capacity of aircraft
- On loads page, clicking icon toggles slots visible
- Performance: editing load fetches jump types, accounts and equipment lists for each slot, should only fetch once

Vulnerabilty
- Form validations
  - limit all inputs to basic
  - Slot must have cost
- use SSL from login page onwards
  - use http://agilewebdevelopment.com/plugins/ssl_requirement
  - look at http digest?
  - use self signed certificate
- tests
- RFuzz?
- PCI DSS regulations relating to e-commerce - OWASP Top 10
- check www.owasp.org

Account name fields should autocomplete on manifest and account pages

Link to New Transaction on Account edit page

Refactor Manifest feature scenarios

Heroku Services
- Backup is available, need to figure out how to use

Export transactions to CSV

- Reduce the ammount of stuff that gets logged in the first place
- Implement periodic log pruning
