Import SkyWriter data

Transactions
- delete a transaction when associated slot is deleted
- prevent a transaction from being deleted if it is for a slot

Manifesting
- Default altitude for jump types
- Default cost for jump type
- Picking our aircraft should blank Other
- Entering Other should uncheck radio buttons
- Display multiple slots dependant on capacity of aircraft
- On loads page, clicking icon toggles slots visible
- Performance: editing load fetches jump types, accounts and equipment lists for each slot, should only fetch once

Vulnerabilty
- Form validations
  - limit all inputs to basic
  - Slot must have cost
- use SSL from login page onwards
  - look at http digest?
  - use self signed certificate

- check www.owasp.org

Account name fields should autocomplete on manifest and account pages

Link to New Transaction on Account edit page
