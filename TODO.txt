Equipment _form partial has an ugly method for getting the right path and action
- suggestion from Rails mailing list was to rename Equipment model to something that has a singular and plural that are different

Default user login should redirect to My Account page

"Successfully logged out" flash message displayed in wrong place 

My Account page should include:
- account

Put Signup link on Login page

Roles
- Manager
  - can do everything a Manifester can
  - can change a user role
  - can perform Maintenance functions
- Manifester
  - can do everything a Default user can
  - can edit manifests
  - can edit transactions
  - can edit accounts
- Default
  - can view own account

Authentication
- forgotten username
- forgotten password
- needs some more feature descriptions

Import SkyWriter data
- Validate input
- Reformat name to be First Last

Show something sensible when no data found (equipment, aircraft, etc)

Transactions
- Transactions should list in date reverse order
- Put "New" link at top of page
- Transactions (and slot) should be links on Account/edit page
- ? link to new transaction from Account/edit page

Manifesting
- Default altitude for jump types
- Default cost for jump type
- Default cost for Equipment?
- Picking our aircraft should blank Other
- Entering Other should uncheck radio buttons
- Display multiple slots dependant on capacity of aircraft
- On loads page, clicking icon toggles slots visible
- Performance: editing load fetches jump types, accounts and equipment lists for each slot, should only fetch once

Vulnerabilty
- Form validations
  - limit all inputs to basic
  - Slot must have cost
- use SSL from login page onwards
  - use http://agilewebdevelopment.com/plugins/ssl_requirement
  - look at http digest?
  - use self signed certificate
- tests
- RFuzz?
- PCI DSS regulations relating to e-commerce - OWASP Top 10
- check www.owasp.org

Link to New Transaction on Account edit page

Refactor Manifest feature scenarios

Heroku Services
- Backup is available, need to figure out how to use

Export transactions to CSV

Log pruning
- Reduce the ammount of stuff that gets logged in the first place
- Implement periodic log pruning

Manage bookings?
- Phone operator enters booking
- Jumper enters booking online
